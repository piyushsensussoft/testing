# Bug Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. **Duplicate Email Sending Bug**
**Problem:** The confirmation email was being sent twice in `LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Fix:** 
- Removed the duplicate email sending code
- Now sends email only once after successful database save

### 2. **Missing Database Integration**
**Problem:** Form was not saving data to Supabase database
**Fix:**
- Added proper Supabase database insertion with error handling
- Added validation for successful save before proceeding with email

### 3. **Zustand Store Not Used**
**Problem:** Lead store was created but not utilized in components
**Fix:**
- Integrated `useLeadStore` in `LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
- Updated store interface to include industry field
- Added proper state management for submitted state and session leads

### 4. **OpenAI API Array Index Bug**
**Problem:** Using wrong array index (`choices[1]`) in email function
**Fix:**
- Changed to correct index (`choices[0]`)
- Added fallback content when API fails
- Added proper error handling for missing API keys

### 5. **No Duplicate Email Prevention**
**Problem:** Same email could be submitted multiple times
**Fix:**
- Added database migration with unique constraint on email
- Added pre-check for existing emails before insertion
- Added graceful handling of duplicate email scenarios with user-friendly messages

### 6. **Poor Error Handling**
**Problem:** No user feedback for errors
**Fix:**
- Added toast notifications for success/error states
- Added loading state with disabled submit button
- Added specific error handling for different failure scenarios

### 7. **Environment Variables Not Used**
**Problem:** Hard-coded API keys and URLs
**Fix:**
- Updated Supabase client to use environment variables
- Added `.env.example` file with proper variable names
- Updated Edge function to handle missing API keys gracefully

### 8. **API Key Configuration Issues**
**Problem:** Wrong environment variable name for Resend API
**Fix:**
- Changed from `RESEND_PUBLIC_KEY` to `RESEND_API_KEY`
- Added validation for API key presence before attempting to send emails

## Next Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - In Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Edge Functions → Environment Variables:
     - Add `RESEND_API_KEY` with your Resend API key
     - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key (optional)

2. **Run Database Migrations:**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

3. **Test the Application:**
   - Test form submission with valid data
   - Test duplicate email scenario
   - Test email sending functionality
   - Verify database records are created

## Security Improvements

- API keys now use environment variables
- Database has unique constraints to prevent duplicates
- Better error handling prevents information leakage
- Graceful fallbacks when external services fail

The application should now work correctly with proper Supabase integration, no duplicate emails, and robust error handling.
